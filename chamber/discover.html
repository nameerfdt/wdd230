                    <h3>History</h3>
                    <p>Folsom's history is closely tied to the California Gold Rush. In 1848, gold was discovered in
                        nearby Coloma, sparking the gold rush that brought thousands of fortune seekers to the region.
                        Folsom's location along the American River made it an important hub for gold miners and
                        prospectors.
                    </p>
                    <p>Folsom was officially founded in 1855 and named after Joseph Libbey Folsom, who was one of the
                        directors of the company that purchased the land where the town was established. Folsom quickly
                        grew as a center of commerce and transportation due to its location on the Sacramento Valley
                        Railroad.
                    </p>
                    <p>One of the most well-known landmarks in Folsom is the Folsom State Prison, which was established
                        in 1880. It gained notoriety for the song "Folsom Prison Blues" by Johnny Cash, who performed at
                        the prison in 1968.</p>
                    <p>Folsom became one of the first cities in the United States to have a hydroelectric power plant in
                        1895. The Folsom Powerhouse, operated by the Sacramento Municipal Utility District (SMUD),
                        played a crucial role in providing electricity to the region.</p>
                    <p>Folsom served as a vital transportation hub during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, thanks
                        to its location along the Sacramento Valley Railroad. The railroad facilitated the
                        transportation of goods and people to and from Folsom, contributing to its economic growth.</p>
                    <p>The Folsom Dam, completed in 1955, was constructed by the United States Army Corps of Engineers
                        to control flooding along the American River. The reservoir created by the dam, Folsom Lake, is
                        a popular recreational area today.</p>
                    <p>In recent decades, Folsom has experienced significant growth and development, becoming a thriving
                        suburb of Sacramento. The city is known for its high quality of life, excellent schools, and
                        recreational amenities.</p>
